# Machine_Learning_Iris_Flower_Classification

This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to build the classification model.

Project Overview:
Dataset: The famous Iris dataset, containing 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species.

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

Goal: Classify the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.


Steps:
1.Load and explore the Iris dataset.
2.Split the data into training and testing sets.
3.Train a KNN classifier.
4.Evaluate the model.
